# Founder & Technical Team Lead @ SeenByte | Expert React Development for Technically Advanced Web Applications

With over seven years of experience in the software engineering industry, I founded and currently lead SeenByte, a US-based deep-tech software engineering company specializing in React web development for digital agencies, SaaS startups, and enterprise teams worldwide. I have a proven track record of leading multiple international projects and consistently achieving impactful results for our partners.

As the founder and technical team lead, I guide the team in analyzing and defining project requirements, writing detailed technical and functional documentation, and managing the life-cycle and deliverables of a wide range of projects. While my primary expertise lies in these areas, I also support other aspects of the business as needed. I take full responsibility for the companyâ€™s projects, overseeing quality assurance, final delivery, as well as ongoing maintenance and support.

Additionally, I actively contribute to recruiting efforts, building and maintaining our internal team, supporting their growth, and ensuring smooth collaboration within agile environments. By maintaining a hands-on leadership approach, I encourage innovation and ensure high-quality results that drive client success and support the continued growth of SeenByte.
